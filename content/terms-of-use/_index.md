 The key to success is to keep your head above the water, never give up. I’m up to something. You should never complain, complaining is a weak emotion, you got life, we breathing, we blessed. I told you all this before, when you have a swimming pool, do not use chlorine, use salt water, the healing, salt water is the healing. Another one. I’m giving you cloth talk, cloth. Special cloth alert, cut from a special cloth. Hammock talk come soon. Wraith talk. Watch your back, but more importantly when you get out the shower, dry your back, it’s a cold world out there.

Congratulations, you played yourself. You see that bamboo behind me though, you see that bamboo? Ain’t nothin’ like bamboo. Bless up. They don’t want us to win. Stay focused. Look at the sunset, life is amazing, life is beautiful, life is what you make it. Fan luv. I told you all this before, when you have a swimming pool, do not use chlorine, use salt water, the healing, salt water is the healing. It’s on you how you want to live your life. Everyone has a choice. I pick my choice, squeaky clean. Surround yourself with angels.

To be successful you’ve got to work hard, to make history, simple, you’ve got to make it. The weather is amazing, walk with me through the pathway of more success. Take this journey with me, Lion! A major key, never panic. Don’t panic, when it gets crazy and rough, don’t panic, stay calm. You see the hedges, how I got it shaped up? It’s important to shape up your hedges, it’s like getting a haircut, stay fresh.

A major key, never panic. Don’t panic, when it gets crazy and rough, don’t panic, stay calm. Put it this way, it took me twenty five years to get these plants, twenty five years of blood sweat and tears, and I’m never giving up, I’m just getting started. Every chance I get, I water the plants, Lion! Find peace, life is like a water fall, you’ve gotta flow. Another one. The other day the grass was brown, now it’s green because I ain’t give up. Never surrender. I told you all this before, when you have a swimming pool, do not use chlorine, use salt water, the healing, salt water is the healing.
