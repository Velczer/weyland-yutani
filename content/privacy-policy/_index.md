The ladies always say Khaled you smell good, I use no cologne. Cocoa butter is the key. I’m giving you cloth talk, cloth. Special cloth alert, cut from a special cloth.

You see that bamboo behind me though, you see that bamboo? Ain’t nothin’ like bamboo. Bless up. Cloth talk. Let’s see what Chef Dee got that they don’t want us to eat. Lion! You smart, you loyal, you a genius. I told you all this before, when you have a swimming pool, do not use chlorine, use salt water, the healing, salt water is the healing. Let’s see what Chef Dee got that they don’t want us to eat. We don’t see them, we will never see them.
